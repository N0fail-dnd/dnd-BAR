			<p class="flavor">Fairies are small, magical creatures with a strong connection to nature and the Feywild. They are known for their playful personalities and innate spellcasting abilities.</p>
			<h4>FAIRY TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your fairy character has the following racial traits.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="feature">Ability Score Increase.</span> Increase one ability score by 2, and increase a different one by 1, or increase three different scores by 1 each.
				<br/>
				<span class="feature">Creature Type.</span> You are a Fey.
				<br/>
				<span class="feature">Size.</span> You are Small.
				<br/>
				<span class="feature">Speed.</span> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.
				<br/>
				<span class="feature">Fairy Magic.</span> You know the druidcraft cantrip. Starting at 3rd level, you can cast faerie fire once per day.

You can cast these spells without material components, and you regain the ability to cast them this way when you finish a long rest.
